If left unchecked, depression can have severe long-term consequences and can affect various aspects of life. Fortunately, it is treatable.

The title sounds weird, right? Let me clarify that for you.

People with anxiety, depression or some kind of mental disorder are present in a notable population of this country as well as all over the world. With its increasing awareness, new ways are being set up to help cure it. Quite recently, Artificial Intelligence & Technology have taken various, rather interesting initiatives for a noble cause, which is, trying to find ways to track and improve mental health.

Many innovations include chat-bots and trackers, inbuilt in apps that communicate exactly how a friend or a close one would. We can share anything with them, our insecurities or impromptu thoughts, deepest fears or secrets without being afraid of any judgments. They are the kind of friends that are there for you always, literally sitting in your pockets or held in your hands.

These friends help you in many ways, that include applications that feature:
- mood and habit trackers
- chat-bots, that converse with the patients and highlight what areas they have to work on.
- sounds, natural or artificial, selected by doctors that may please or calm the mind.
- recorded sessions for different problems that help relax the mind. Like, reduce stress, calm anxiety or anger management.

Top five apps picked for you with varied features are:
