If you see a guy in the corridors of ASCO, bobbing his head to songs played on his earphones, with his hands covered by tattoos that have hidden meanings, you have probably spotted Vasu. At such young age, Vasu has managed to accomplish the tedious and arduous task of making people hum to his melodious songs, titled, “Tu” & “Kaha Hai”. He is someone who has an artistic flair when it comes to his interests. He is quite a storyteller even when it comes to casual conversations, and is sure to leave you engaged till the end.


##### - So Vasu tell me a little bit about yourself?

I was brought up in Delhi but my origins are from Kashmir. I am an 18-year-old guy, who you’d probably find singing around. I’ve wanted to write songs since I was a kid. I like writing poems too. The songs I write are for everybody, but the poetry, that’s reserved just for me. When I first started writing songs, it was very difficult. After writing a mere two lines, I would give up and crumple up the paper and throw it. But now, I’ve had my fair share of incidents, which have inspired me to write more songs, and there’s no stopping me now.

##### - How did you come to Amity?

I got into 2-3 colleges in DU, but the courses didn’t interest me. I was interested in Journalism, and Amity School of Communication was one of the topmost colleges offering the course. I think I’d probably get into trouble for saying this, but I like watching Arnab Goswami.

Another reason could be the fact that I really enjoy debates.

##### - That’s great, so let’s talk about your songs. Usually, artists portray what they have seen or experienced. What is the story behind yours? Did you experience those feelings yourself or have you seen them around you?

It’s a long story. So my first song “Kaha Hai” wasn’t the first song that I wrote. My second song “Tu” which I released recently was actually the first song that I wrote. I suffered from depression and I don’t want to talk much about that. I guess it’s because of the fact that I’m still not completely over it. There were many phases where I wanted to give up, but I didn’t. After these two, (Kaha Hai & Tu) there’s no stopping now.

The inspiration, well, I can give you a gist, because it is something very hard for me to talk about. Both of the songs are inspired by one person, with whom my relationship went awry. I wrote “Tu” when we were together, but when things went downhill. I didn’t feel like publishing that song, so I wrote “Kaha Hai”. I don’t think she knows that she was the muse. Also, both my songs had a line about ‘moon’, because we shared memories and connected a lot to it—it was like our thing.

##### - Well, that is some inspiration. Moving forward, how did you come up with the courage to upload “Tu”? What moment did you decide that you won’t hold onto it anymore, and release it?

It occurred to me on a random day. I realized and agreed that “yeah, she is the inspiration.” But more than that, I wanted to write songs, so that people could relate to my songs. So that when they listen to it, hopefully, they feel the bliss and emotions that are buried deep inside of them. Fame and money don’t really matter to me. What matters to me, is people actually liking my work and being able to relate to it. “Chu Lo” by The Local Train, was one of the main reasons why I wanted to release my work.

##### - Since most of the artists have idols or someone whose music they follow. Who is yours?

My dad is actually my idol, he happens to be a Kashmiri folk singer. It’s his hobby. We are Kashmiri Pandits and I don’t know when we got dispersed from there. I do follow The Local Train’s music, though. Also, Prateek Kuhad, because I really can’t help it. He makes me feel things when I hear him sing. Indie Pop is a genre that I love and work on. Indie Pop all the way!

##### - Oh, then how did this passion of music kick in? I mean how did you know that being a musician/singer was the path for you? Is it because of your father or are you just passionate about it?

The most important person, the topmost priority in my life, is my Dadu (grandfather). He is my darling. He used to tell me that when I was 4 years old, I used to sit in front of the mandir in our house and used to chant ‘Om Jai Jagdish’ continuously. I have never learned instruments professionally, I just know things. I watch them and learn, and when I play the instruments, they just come to me, as if I had played them all along. It's been this way since the beginning. When I was in the 4th grade, I used to play the bongos, drums, and keyboards. In 7th grade, I just saw the movements on how to play tabla and I could play it well after a little practice. They just make sense to me. It’s as if, instruments speak to me.

##### - What are your interests apart from music?

Photography. I like capturing bizarre things and aesthetic settings. Also, I like traveling solo. #roamalone.

##### - You are very well liked by students, even on Instagram. You have a great following, especially from a lot of girls. What is your take on that? Do you like the attention? Or are you uncomfortable?

Appreciation for my art is something I see without any gender biases. I am equally happy when guys praise me. Although sometimes, when girls text me to appreciate me for my photos, and not my art, I get a bit uncomfortable and I don't know how to react. I get a little flustered by that kind of attention. What should I do, how do I respond to it, by still being humble and not hurting somebody’s feelings?

##### -  Do you have a girlfriend?

No, no I don't.

##### - So tell me about your happiest moment in your music journey until now?

My happy moment, at any time, is people relating to my music. The brightest moment was when my school juniors approached me on Instagram and told me that I should come visit them and that they miss me. I didn’t even recognize most of them. They said that I was an inspiration to them. It was such a great moment for me. It means that I am doing something, which is making people happy.

Also, there was this girl who was from Lucknow and she even told me that she had stopped listening to Bollywood music and started listening to Indie Pop because of me, and is exploring great artists like Prateek Kuhad, which was also pretty amazing for me.

It's the only thing that matters to me. Like I said, “creating content which is relatable and makes people happy.”

##### - What are the current projects you’re working on? And should we expect any future songs soon?

‘Global Music Institute’, had a contest, all over India, and I had participated and submitted “Tu”. I didn’t hope that I’d get in.
During the Pedestal event, ‘#meforyou’, I got a call informing me that I’d gotten selected in the Top 10.

I am soon hoping to perform at ‘The Piano Man Jazz Club’ if I win it. It’s one of the most amazing places for music lovers and is considered one of the establishing points. Even ‘The Local Train’ performed there when they were new.

My next song will probably come out in May. It is about heartbreak. As Zakir Khan once said: “this is the generation of heartbroken people.” So I will write for them and I am sure they will relate to it too.

##### - Tell us something people don't know about you.

People think I am some Casanova, which I'm clearly not. They even ask if I do drugs, but I haven’t touched either alcohol or drugs ever in my life.
Also, I love dogs. #doggoteam. I have a cat, a dog, and a bird too.

###### - What's your favorite song?

Chu Lo - The Local Train
