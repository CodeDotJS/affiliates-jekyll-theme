__Understanding the concept and history of Abstract Art__

Have you ever looked at a painting and thought,” What is this?!”, or ever remarked, “My five-year-old son could do that, what is so great about it anyway!”

The non-realistic type of drawings, funny use of colour, and unconventional methods of representing something is often seen to be quite frustrating for the viewers. Out of all these questions, the most important one that we ask is “What do they mean?” Or perhaps, “What was the artist thinking while making this painting?” All of these questions do have an answer and there is, in fact, a concrete reason why an artist is painting in such an unconventional style.

The concept of Abstraction is easy to understand, but it is extremely difficult to follow. The word “abstract” refers to all those elements which are present in the universe that do not physically coexist but has a state of being.  Such elements include subjects like the concept of love, sadness, excitement and a variety of emotions. Even the aspect of spirituality comes under the umbrella of Abstraction. Hence, the subject of Abstraction encompasses many such thoughts that cannot be found in a solid, tangible form but are felt by us in everyday reality. Therefore, it is safe to say that the concept of Abstract painting is about communicating such intangible elements of the universe, which coexist alongside the physical world. The statements and questions that we hold about abstract art, like “anyone could do this”, or “what is the meaning of such absurdity”, are actually wrong. Abstract art requires a very good understanding of colour, rhythm, balance, harmony, textures, and a good perception of aesthetics. These skills can only be achieved when an artist has already passed the tests of creating conventional artworks. By conventional art, I mean, the art which is generally appreciated by the public. This primarily includes artworks like portraits, still life, landscapes and the like.

Abstract art was never introduced to the world suddenly, but became a product of continuous transformation of existing art over the years. Portrait and landscape painters became penniless when the technology of photography was introduced to the world. This medium could capture reality in the most distinct form and thus, became more popular than paintings. As a result, a new era began, when the painters decided to view reality from the filter of imagination rather than simply recording it. Brush strokes changed their patterns; colours became more vivid, following the path of expression and mimicry of subjects as distorted images started filling up canvases. It was the age of Impressionism that had filled European minds with new possibilities of what art can actually accomplish. Impressionists took it upon themselves to present the natural elements of the world in a somewhat unnatural way, but not totally shifting away from it. So, they started stylising, simplifying, and even flattening spatial components of the subjects they wanted to paint. The most spectacular example is Vincent Van Gogh’s The Starry Night which became a masterpiece of the Impressionist Age.  The swirls, the thin brush strokes and the magnificent use of the colour Prussian blue, made it an ensorcelling night sky.  Even Claude Monet’s depiction of The Arrival of the Normandy Train is also an excellent example of Impressionist artistry.

The inception of The Industrial Revolution and the change in lifestyle of the European people started to create a great impact on Art. The chaos on the streets, the smoke rising from the chimneys and lust for material possession made artists like Georges Seurat and Paul Cezanne paint works like A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte and Maison Maria with a view of Chateau Noir respectively. In the former painting, Seurat had magnificently displayed the chaotic world by creating a crowded scenario on a grassy patch of land, simultaneously displaying the puppetry of humanity in the material world by creating doll-like human beings. Seurat’s painting was a major breakthrough as paintings had begun to reduce their mimicry of nature and started paying more attention to its didactic component.  As the years passed by, artists started to assume more and more freedom in creating art and made the viewers pay more attention to colour, texture and distorted imagery. Artists like Giacomo Bala wanted to reflect the pace and the overstimulation of the modern, urban life and he did so by making the famous Dynamism of A Dog on Leash with a stroke of peacock blue. Bala showed the absurd urgency of the modern people by creating distortion in the image, making the dog’s limbs hazy as if to show it was running.

The disorder and disarray in the European society were shown in a somewhat different way in Germany on account of the Industrial Revolution. Here, artists totally shifted away from depicting any form of naturalistic components in artworks and created an absolutely unrealistic style of paintings. The focus was made on just the colour, and absurd alien-like shapes started filling the canvases. Thus, began the birth of the age of Expressionism. One of the earliest examples of German expressionist art is Ernest Ludwig Kirchner’s Dresden Street, which uses abstraction, unnatural, and unreal colours to depict chaos and anxiety of the modern world.

Apart from the influences of the Industrial Revolution, the era of Expressionism was also motivated by African Tribal Art, Russian Folk Art, and art by children. The contemporaries of Kirchner became extremely influenced by such subjects- primarily Franz Marc and Wassily Kandinsky. Marc used Abstraction to connect with the natural world. His famous works like The Yellow Cow and Deer in a Monastery Garden used colour and texture to draw the emotion of the audience to what the artist actually feels about the natural world. While Marc focused on the natural world, Kandinsky took inspiration from the spiritual world.  The most famous quote of Kandinsky was: “My art is what the spectator lives or feels under the effect of the form and colour combinations of the picture”. For Kandinsky, abstraction was not opposed to realism, but it was realism. He attributed abstract concepts like spiritual enlightenment, consciousness, emotions, and transcendence to be real elements present in the world. Kandinsky’s Square with concentric circles and his Compositions are one of his best works.

Expressionism also led to the birth of Cubism pioneered by Pablo Picasso and Diego Rivera. The idea of Cubism revolved around breaking subject matter into different geometric shapes and showing multiple sides of the subjects at once. It was a way to fuse multiple perspectives and moments in time at once. One of my favourite paintings of this era is Picasso’s Guernica and The Girl with the Mandolin.  Guernica is seen as a protest to the Nazi bombing of the town of Guernica. It depicts the horrifying images of war and tragedy by condensing the special limitations of the canvas and volunteering to give a three-dimensional effect to it.

Science also had a great influence on Abstract Art. Artists like Hilma Aft Klint painted pictures like Primordial Chaos by combining spirituality and her interest in science. She aimed in depicting invisible forces in her paintings like X rays, infrared rays and many alike invisible rays from the spectrum.

This new form of Abstract Art had begun to astonish the world. Another art form started by Annie Besant and Charles Leadbeater, called “thought-forms” became widely popular. They also published a book by the same name in 1901 claiming their works to be “vague pure emotions”. They painted and printed extremely unusual images, saying that “emotions, sounds, ideas etc, manifest as visual auras”.

As the years passed by, Art was becoming more and more unusual and at the same time, very personal. Artists began to see the world through their own subjective filters. Piet Mondrian devised his own way of seeing nature around him. Mondrian stripped away the naturalistic components of a particular image and started simplifying them into gridded arrangements in form of vertical and horizontal lines, creating binary oppositions. Some of the most famous works of Piet Mondrian are The Grey Tree and Composition with Red, Yellow, Blue, and Black.   Jackson Pollock, tremendously influenced by the Abstract Art culture, made his paintings by placing the canvas on the ground and used unconventional materials like sand and sawdust. He took buckets of house paint, dipped his brushes into them and sprinkled it randomly on the canvas. The result was never a painting with disproportionate colouring and random textures, but was smooth, balanced, and rhythmic and had a harmony attached to it. Blue Poles and Autumn Rhythm are my personal favourite.

However, there is also another very important feature of Abstract Art which I have not specified and that is the power of Simplicity. To attain Simplicity in art is one of the most difficult things to do. Every artist dreams of expressing a chunk of emotions with the simplest elements of art. Perhaps by a line, or just by the colour or shape or texture, artists aim to deliver a world of emotions. Mark Rothko was one of the few artists who accomplished this goal. Rothko’s paintings are extremely simple to look at. They do not possess any complexity or distorted imagery in them. They are just rectangular boxes of colour drawn on the canvas. Sometimes they are drawn on the top of each other or colour coated over another colour- White Over Red; Four Darks in Red. Rothko said that he wanted to do away with restrictions, the barrier between the artist and the idea, and, the idea and the observer. As a result, Rothko focused on the very basic component of art- colour.  Many viewers and critics have said that standing in front of a Rothko painting feels like a religious experience as it says something transcendental and spiritual. Rothko used to put a great deal of thought while making his works. By considering a wide variety of emotions like pain, agony, spirituality, depression, excitement, war, politics and the like, and tried to represent it with colour. It is not an artwork about nothing, but it is an artwork about everything. Rothko once said that this style “allowed me to deal with the human emotion, human drama, as much as I can possibly experience”. Dominique De Menil (an art collector and philanthropist) said that Rothko’s work depicts “the tragic mystery of our perishable condition, the silence of God, the unbearable silence of God!”

Art has continued to evolve with the evolution of society and artists have been trying to find newer ways to showcase abstract notions of the world. As conciseness and simplicity have become the main destination for emerging artists, they are trying to devise new ways and methods to convey greater emotions in the simplest way. Perhaps they dream of a time when just a solid brush stroke would be able to convey the entire emotion of the world, very much like Stephen Hawking’s quest to find a single equation to define the entire universe. It is very important for viewers to understand that not all art makes sense. There are many works of art that are meant to evoke personal feelings rather than perform a simple mimicry of the world. That is the supreme power of art and that is what makes it stronger than photography, which captures the reality as it is. To sum it all up, I would like to leave you with a quote by David Lynch: “I don’t know why people expect art to make sense when they accept the very fact that life itself does not make sense”.
