The date is 23rd July 2017, and we are currently at Lord’s Cricket Stadium! In an exhilarating encounter, the host team England bested the proficient Indian team by 9 runs, making it England’s 4th world cup win in the 2017 Women’s Cricket World Cup Final.

Just 20 years before this triumphant victory, the English Women’s Cricket team were left unpaid and were forced to buy their own kit, comprising of skirts and long socks. Furthermore, they were even banned from the member’s pavilion at Lord’s, the country’s most revered cricket club. And now, two decades into the future, we witnessed the same venue marking the beginning of a new age in Women’s Cricket. The game also saw a record coverage of an estimated 180 million people, who watched the prestigious final match. There was a reported 300% increase in viewing hours, in comparison to the previous game in 2013.

In the last 4 years, the cricketing world has seen a significant turnaround in Women’s cricket administration, with the ICC taking a bold step to telecast Women’s cricket in 131 nations. The board also doubled the winning price to $2 million dollars and appointed its long-time partner and sponsor, PepsiCo’s CEO- Indra Nooyi, as ICC’s independent female director. An award for the Best Women’s Cricket Initiative of the Year was also introduced. Gone are the days when women’s cricket was considered trivial, when the Board’s assistance was the sole reason for partial success; and family earnings paid for a girl’s cricketing gear.  It has now become a well-respected international game all around the world.

Women’s cricket has now become a viable career choice for the next generation of women. The ICC has also been striving towards more global exposure for women’s cricket. The introduction of the Kia Super League in Britain and Women’s Big Bash League in Australia, has greatly expanded the potential for the rise of new stars. The success of such leagues has given the stimulus to other cricketing bodies to work on with their plans of introducing a Women’s Cricketing Association.

The women cricketers have gained wide recognition. Their achievements have now started to challenge male cricketers in terms of popularity and on-field accomplishments. The performance of Australian All- Rounder Ellyse Perry stands as a testament to this fact. She is one of the best performing all-rounders, among women’s as well as men’s cricket in recent times. She has also been honoured as the most celebrated Women’s Cricketing Star of all time. Other women cricketers like Mithali Raj, Sarah Taylor, Smriti Mandhana, Stafanie Taylor and Suzie Bates have gained immense recognition and their performances have been on par with male standards.

## Women’s Cricket in India

In a nation where Cricket is celebrated like a religion, BCCI is gradually taking steps towards promoting women’s cricket in the country. They have introduced a fee hike at both domestic and international levels, translating into more tours; expanded the national season and have also promised separate committees for women at BCCI. However, the board has shown hesitation towards introducing Women’s IPL, but is planning to conduct Exhibition Games during IPL 2019. The announcement is likely to happen after the Election Commission announces the Election Schedule. This will allow BCCI to finally fix schedules for this year’s IPL.

The transformation in popularity of Women’s Cricket in India can be understood by the fact that back in 2017, just before World Cup, Mithali Raj was hosted by less than a dozen journalists when she outlined her plans for the biggest event of Women’s Cricket. India narrowly failed to capture the World Cup but the impact that the team had laid during whole World Cup, be it Harmanpreet Kaur’s 171 in semi-final against mighty Aussies or Smriti Mandhana’s and Jhulan Goswami’s performance with bat and ball respectively. It was enough to gather over 60 journalists to JW Marriot in Mumbai less than 3 days after World Cup Final. The final drew a viewership of more than 100 million in India alone. The potential that the Indian women’s team holds can be proven by the fact that Mithali Raj is Highest Run Scorer in Women’s Cricket, being the only woman to score more than 6000 runs, with an average of 51.33. Jhulan Goswami is also the leading wicket-taker in women’s cricket, with 203 career wickets with an impressive average of 21.77.
