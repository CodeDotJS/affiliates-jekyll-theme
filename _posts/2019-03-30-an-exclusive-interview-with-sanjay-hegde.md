Advocates have the gift of people’s trust, to represent the wronged in front of the system. They provide justice to the people and protect the integrity of the law, says the youthful Senior Advocate of the Supreme Court. For the past 3 decades, Sanjay Hegde has been honing his skills in the judicial system. To get some much-needed answers about the judiciary, Pedestal was in a conversation with Senior Advocate Sanjay Hegde.

Sir! First of all, congratulations on your thirty years of the journey as an advocate.

Thank you so much!

##### Q-How do you see these thirty years as a journey? And what would you like to say to the aspiring lawyers and advocates who look up to you?

See, thirty years is a long period in a lifetime, but for a lawyer, it’s a pretty short period. For judges and other senior advocates, thirty years is nothing. Some people have to wait for 50 years, and thanks to increased life spans, we have people like Mr. Nariman, who can tell the Supreme Court, “In my 67 years of practice…” A statement like this justifies that he has been making solid arguments even before the Supreme Court judges were even conceived. It gives a certain depth to a lawyer as time goes by; he never repeats the same mistake. As far as the aspiring lawyers are concerned, I would like to say, “दिलसेकामकर, दिमागसे charge कर! और judge सेमतडर!” You have to remember that somebody has trusted you to go on to that podium and speak to the judge about them.

#### Q-Sir, The Collegium recommended and elevated Justice Sanjiv Khanna and Justice Dinesh Maheshwari, ignoring the seniority of judges like Justice Getta Mittal and others. The Bar Council of India termed this as whimsical and arbitrary! Sir, do you think the collegium model is a system that is transparent enough to elect?

I don’t know what goes on inside the collegium. People who have been inside the Collegium have also said that it is an entirely non-transparent medium. Justice Ruma Pal said in an interview said, “What happens in the collegium is one of the best-kept secrets.” Collegium is a very transient body because people keep on retiring. It is not like the same team remains for a period of two to three years and has the body of selection. What happens is, a selection committee approves of a few names, and when the composition of the selection committee changes, the next set comes and disproves it on the grounds that someone else is more deserving. However, the transparency has somehow increased in recent times, primarily because Justice Chelameswar insisted on it. And resolutions and updates are being put out through the websites. I do not think that the transparency is enough, but I would also like to say that in some cases, transparency is working against the system.

##### Q-Sir, pendency in Judiciary is an issue that India is facing. Justice Dipak Misra expressed concerns at the3.3 crores figure. Recently, the figures touched 4 crores, and the graph keeps changing in terms of the High Court, Supreme Court, and Lower courts. What do you think is the way forward in decreasing the pendency of cases?

I do not think that careers are going to decrease. As more and more people become literate and become aware of their rights, they will start resorting to the judicial system. What the system needs to do is to start thinking smart. Ask, who is the biggest litigant? The biggest litigant in the courts is the government. The government is either denying something to its citizens, forcing the citizen to come to court, or alternatively, if it thinks that the citizen has got away with something and brought him to court to either recover taxes, money, or property. There also must be some disincentives against wasting the court’s time. In countries abroad, what happens is, most of the work is done outside the court’s time and ultimately what is presented to the judge is a legal question for his resolution. In India, we do all of that in the courts. So ultimately, if a judge has to deal with 50-100 cases, he just ends up giving another date to further the proceedings.

##### Q-Sir, decriminalization of politics is very important for the nation. The Supreme Court, on December 5th, 2018, asked all the lower courts to settle all the cases related to politicians who have any charge or accusations of any crime against them. Should the politicians who just have charges, or are accused of a crime, be barred from contesting the elections? There’s a caveat that they can either be guilty or innocent but none is proven.

See, previously the convention was, if in a criminal case there were charges filed by the court (as opposed to the charge-sheet filed by the police) then at that stage, with the framing of charges by the court and the matter going to the trial, the politician needed to step down from the elections. Because any political party can file an FIR against the candidate of the opposition, and file a charge-sheet, to get them out of the elections, but no one can force the courts to admit the charges and move the matter to trial.

##### Q-Sir, what are your thoughts on women entering the Sabarimala temple? Is it the case of violation of Article 25 (freedom of conscience and free profession of religion), or Article 14 (equality before the law, and equal protection by the law)?

Our constitution also has Article 17 (abolishing untouchability). It was specifically put in to open all temples to all people; not only with regards to caste. Now, what happened in Sabarimala, there was a rule that was created under an Act after a judgment of the Kerala High Court; that was seen to be unconstitutional! There was no divine, God-spoken law in ancient tradition or custom that was challenged. Let us assume that an ancient custom was challenged, even that has to yield to the constitution. It was pointed out in front of the court that the essential religious practice is particularr to religion, not to the places of worship.

##### Q-Sir, as per Section 375 of the IPC, only a man commits the offense of rape and not a woman. Do you think this section should be amended and made gender neutral?

Previously, it was not required to be gender neutral because we had Section 377 in the IPC, so if a man got raped by another man…

##### Q-Or a woman?

A woman raping a man… there’s some biology also involved there, so the court did not go there. But now there have been cases where things have taken place without the full consent of a man. This has to be a legislative call. We had 375 and 376 for one set of sexual actions and 377 for the other. Now that Article 377 has been read down into only a specific part, it might be a good decision to amalgamate the two sections and render a gender-neutral explanation of the law.

##### Q-Sir, prostitution is partially legal in India; many think it should be illegal. Supreme Court also said it way back in 2009-11, “It should be legalized if you cannot curb it.” What is your thought on this?

It is living on the earnings of prostitution or forcing someone to prostitution which is illegal. A transaction, on the other hand? It is essentially trading of consent. If she consents for money, it is her body and she is entitled to it. There is also a sociological factor that India must consider. We have an appalling sex difference ratio. We have just about 900 women for 1000 men, and the gap is forever widening. And you have a huge migrant population of young males into the cities. How else will you handle the problem unless you facilitate and make things available?
