To understand the true gravity of this newly developed antibiotic resistance, we must delve deep into what it actually means and how it is caused.

Anti microbial resistance is the ability of the microbe or bacteria to resist the effects of medication used to treat it. Such microbes pose a dire threat to the safety of millions. In the event that such microbes develop immunity to more than one type of antibiotic, a super bug is created, with the capacity to kill millions. Humanity is in the process of engineering such a super bug and it is happening as we speak.

#### __What are bacteria?__

Bacteria are one of the oldest living organisms on our planet, being the smallest thing we consider life and with an immense potential to survive. Bacteria can be found everywhere and most of them are harmless to us. There are millions of bacteria already in our body and help us to survive. Although, certain bacteria can invade our body, spread quickly and cause immense damage, even kill us.

#### __The introduction of antibiotics__

Millions of people used to die due to bacterial infections until the development of a super weapon, antibiotics. These, along with vaccinations, revolutionised medicine and saved millions of life.

Antibiotics kill the vast majority of susceptible bacteria, leaving a small group of survivors that are taken care of by our immune system fairly easily. But how do antibiotics do this?

#### __The mechanism of killing bacteria__

Imagine a bacterium as a complex machine, with thousands of intricate processes going on that keep it alive. Antibiotics interfere with and disrupt this complex machinery, for instance, interfering with the cell's metabolism, slowing down its ability to reproduce. Other antibiotics attack DNA and stop it from replicating, ultimately killing them. All of this is done without bothering body cells.

But gradually, evolution has made things quite complicated. By random chance, certain bacteria invading the body might have evolved immunity to protect themselves. For example, intercepting the antibiotics and changing them before they can harm. A few immune bacteria are not a problem unless one of them escapes. Bacteria have this ability to share this immunity with other bacteria cells as well.

A variety of superbugs already exist in the world today, at hospitals especially, as they provide a perfect breeding ground.

Today, we treat antibiotics as a commodity rather than the game changing achievement of science that they actually are. This has led to a peculiar disconnect. Developing countries suffer an acute shortage of antibiotics while in developed countries, they are prescribed too freely and taken without care. Antibiotics should be a lost resort drug and not taken because our cold may seem annoying. Adding to this, the meat production industry also poses a problem wherein animals are packed in large numbers in unfavourable and bad conditions to ensure cheaper meat. Antibiotics are given to these animals to kill as many bacteria as possible. As a result, we have produced more and more bacteria that are resistant to antibiotics.

To counteract this, we have stronger antibiotics to combat these resistant bacteria. But these must be administered with great care so as to not create any other superbugs.

In late 2015, although, bad news surfaced in China. A new bacteria was discovered that was resistant to the drug â€˜colistin', a powerful last ditch antibiotic.

Colistin is rarely used to its adverse effects on the liver, being a very powerful as well as harmful drug. Thus, not much resistance could occur against it making the news of a new resistant superbug all the more terrifying. A more close to home example are the rising cases of neonatal sepsis in newborns due to bacterial resistance in North India.

This might have happened due to the fact that millions of farm animals (especially pigs) in China, have been given colistin for years. The resistance was from animal to animal and then passed down to humans from the consumption of these animals

As per a recent scoping report in 2017 in India, resistance of broad spectrum antibiotics is also abundantly prevalent. These are prescribed extremely carelessly which has contributed greatly to bacterial resistance. Excessive usage of commonly used antibiotics, like azithromycin, has also contributed to the creation of superbugs.

On average, there are over 100,000 flights all over the world each day, creating an interconnected network and allowing people to travel all around the world. By creating our modern world, we have established an excellent transport system for a dangerous pandemic.

#### __The fight is not over!__

But we do not need to panic just yet. Bacteria evolve. So do humans. New drugs are created everyday as old ones become obsolete. Advancements in science are taking place at every moment. The problem is grave yet the battle is far from over. If we are careful enough, superbugs might not turn out to be so super after all.
